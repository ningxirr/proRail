# ProRail
ProRail is a mobile application designed to offer users easy and convenient access to train transportation information. The app provides users with a personalized route based on their behavior and allows them to search for train schedules, routes, fares, and stations in Bangkok and the metropolitan area. It serves as an essential tool for both locals and tourists, offering a navigation system to guide passengers when traveling by train. With its user-friendly interface and navigation system, ProRail enables users to plan their trips by adding up to three stops in one route, allowing them to make informed decisions regarding train travel. Overall, ProRail has successfully achieved the goal of helping all passengers and ensuring overall satisfaction based on user testing.
